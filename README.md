# corn-ordinal-neuralnet


This repository contains the orginal model code and experiment logs for the paper "Deep Neural Networks for Rank Consistent Ordinal Regression based on Conditional Probabilities."

If you are interested in using CORN, we recommend the user friendly PyTorch implementation and tutorials in the `coral-pytorch` library. However, if you just want to convert your existing classifier to a ordinal regression model, check the 3 simple steps in the [`./model-code/simple-scripts`](./model-code/simple-scripts) README.
