# corn-ordinal-neuralnet


This repository contains the orginal model code and experiment logs for the paper "Deep Neural Networks for Rank Consistent Ordinal Regression based on Conditional Probabilities."

If you are interested in using CORN, we recommend the user friendly PyTorch implementation and tutorials in the `coral-pytorch` library.
