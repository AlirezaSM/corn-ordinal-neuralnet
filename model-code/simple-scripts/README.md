These are simple demo scripts for the different methods compared in this work, including our newly proposed CORN method. For these, we use MNIST only to keep it simple, but note that MNIST is not an ordinal dataset of course.



The code we used for the experiments in the paper can be found under [../refactored-version](../refactored-version).
